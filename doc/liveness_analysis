A variable x is live at statement s if
- There exists a statement s' that uses x
- There is a path from s to s'
- That path has no intervening assignment to x

* Rule 1
    x is live if it is live in one of the control paths
* Rule 2
    x is live before s if it is read by s
* Rule 3
    x is dead if there is a write to x and the rhs does not refer to x
* Rule 4
    x is the same liveness if a statement does not refer to it

Algorithm
    Let all L(...) = false initially
    Repeat until all statements s satisfy rules 1-4
    Pick s where one of 1-4 does not hold and update using the appropriate rule.
