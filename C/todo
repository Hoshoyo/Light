numeric literals better type inference
type max size now is 32bit
size_of struct with only a character is 4
variable declared void ( a := arr[0]; where arr is ^void)
<<= not working
referencing main in a variable causes error since we renamed it to __light_main
enum reflecting



// done
referencing a declared variable inside a for loop does not work
