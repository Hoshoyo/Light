investigate dot operator when struct type is still not internalized
strings escape sequences in C backend are wrong
numeric literals better type inference
type max size now is 32bit
size_of struct with only a character is 4
enum reflecting
function returning wrong type causes circular dependencies
incomplete struct literals


// done
internalization of pointers to aliases that are not declared do not cause an error
referencing a declared variable inside a for loop does not work
referencing main in a variable causes error since we renamed it to __light_main
<<= not working
variable declared void ( a := arr[0]; where arr is ^void)
