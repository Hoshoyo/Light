#bugs

- this causes error, to fix just need to syntax sugar expression to be a block with 1 command.
if i != 0
	print_str(", ");

// when proc returns void this is allowed somehow
b := proc();

- this causes warning in the c backend and crashes the compiler if string is not declared
main :: () -> s32 {
	a := "Hello".data;
	return cast(s32)a;
}

#changes

- change cast to be .(type)
- dereference pointer on . operator
- check return in all paths, proc with no return clause and other commands is ignored when returning any non-void
- make array infer its size from expression

#backlog

- check for end of stream within comment
- do better errors in parser stage and check for end of stream
- do better errors in semantic stage
