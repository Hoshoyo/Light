#bugs

- use foreign library name to link
- string escaping
- assignment of arrays
- constant in type definition
- make forward decls declarable more than once

- this causes warning in the c backend
main :: () -> s32 {
	a := "Hello".data;
	return cast(s32)a;
}
- check constants

- verify if main is declared before compiling
	if not, then compile a .obj file (for now)


#changes

- dereference pointer on . operator
- check return in all paths, proc with no return clause and other commands is ignored when returning any non-void
- make array infer its size from expression

#features

- type alias
- file scope
- switch
- scoped functions
- namespaces

#backlog

- check for end of stream within comment
- do better errors in parser stage and check for end of stream
- do better errors in semantic stage
