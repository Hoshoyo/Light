#bugs

- make includes in files from where they are

- this causes warning in the c backend and crashes the compiler if string is not declared
main :: () -> s32 {
	a := "Hello".data;
	return cast(s32)a;
}

- verify if main is declared before compiling


#changes

- change cast to be .(type)
- dereference pointer on . operator
- check return in all paths, proc with no return clause and other commands is ignored when returning any non-void
- make array infer its size from expression

#features

- more useful 'for' command

#backlog

- check for end of stream within comment
- do better errors in parser stage and check for end of stream
- do better errors in semantic stage
