#todo

- fix bug where enum value not being declared causes a crash in compilation if used

- default values for procedure arguments and structure fields.
- multiple line strings avoid lexer line counter
- variadic functions
- better error when enum type mismatch happens
- bytecode implement all language
- gcc warning shift more than the register size holds
- constant in type definition
- make forward decls declarable more than once
- check constants
- implement typeof

#backlog

- multiple line string
- check for end of stream within comment
- do better errors in parser stage and check for end of stream
- do better errors in semantic stage
- check return in all paths, proc with no return clause and other commands is ignored when returning any non-void
- make array infer its size from expression
- implement union literals
- file scope
- switch
- scoped functions
- namespaces
- check cast to static array
